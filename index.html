            <div class="content-text">
                Hello! I'm Allan Philip, and I'm passionate about transforming how children in rural Rwanda experience reading. Through my ENT 110 project, I've embarked on an incredible journey to address a critical challenge that I believe holds the key to unlocking Rwanda's future potential.
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-text">
                I discovered that children in rural Rwanda have limited access to engaging books outside their formal education, and reading for personal development is often viewed as non-essential. This realization sparked my mission to create something extraordinary: <strong>Book Buddies Lounge</strong> - community reading spaces that transform reading from a neglected activity into an exciting, culturally-valued experience.
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>My Mission:</strong> Give every child aged 6-14 the opportunity to explore storybooks and non-fiction through fun, social activities that build the critical thinking and creativity skills essential for Rwanda's future.

            <div class="content-text">
                My vision is simple yet powerful: This isn't just about books - it's about nurturing the next generation of innovators and leaders. Join me as I share how I identified this problem, developed my solution, and learned invaluable lessons about entrepreneurship, community engagement, and the power of reading to change lives.

                <h1>How I Discovered a Hidden Crisis</h1>
                <p>My path from observation to action</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-text">
                My entrepreneurial journey began during a community visit to a rural village in Rwanda. I was volunteering at a local school when I noticed something that would change my perspective forever. During break time, while children in urban areas might be reading picture books or discussing stories, these brilliant young minds were playing with sticks and stones - not because they preferred it, but because it was their only option.
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-box">

            </div>
            
            <div class="content-text">
                I started asking questions. I spoke with teachers, parents, and community leaders. What I discovered broke my heart but also ignited my entrepreneurial spirit. Parents genuinely wanted their children to succeed, but many viewed reading storybooks as "luxury" or "foreign influence." Teachers were overwhelmed, focusing solely on curriculum requirements.
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-text">
                The turning point came when I met 8-year-old Grace, who told me she loved the one fairy tale book at her school but had read it seventeen times because it was the only story available. Her eyes lit up when she talked about imagining new adventures, but then dimmed when she realized she had no new stories to discover.

                <strong>My Prototype Approach:</strong> I created a physical mockup using cardboard, colored paper, and borrowed furniture to simulate a Book Buddies Lounge corner.

                <strong>Key Learning:</strong> This simple question made me realize I had been thinking too narrowly about age groups. The most engaged participants were mixed-age groups where older children naturally mentored younger ones.

                This project transformed my understanding of entrepreneurship, problem-solving, and community engagement in ways I never expected.
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-text">
                <strong>My Biggest Surprise:</strong> I initially thought the main barrier was lack of books. Through my research and interviews, I discovered the real challenge was cultural perception and community systems. Parents weren't against reading - they were protecting their children from what they perceived as irrelevant or potentially harmful influences.
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>What I'd Do Differently:</strong> I would start with community conversations before developing any solution. I spent weeks perfecting my prototype before really understanding what the community wanted. Next time, I'd involve community members as co-designers from day one, not just feedback providers at the end.
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-text">
                <strong>Skills I Developed:</strong> This project pushed me far outside my comfort zone. I learned to conduct respectful interviews across language and cultural barriers, to iterate based on user feedback rather than my assumptions, and to present ideas in ways that connect with different audiences.
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-text">
                <strong>The Validation That Mattered Most:</strong> When parents started asking when Book Buddies Lounge would open permanently, I knew we had created something valuable. But the real validation came when children began creating their own stories inspired by what they read - exactly the creativity and critical thinking outcomes I hoped to achieve.

More importantly, I want to see measurable improvements in children's creativity, critical thinking, and communication skills.
